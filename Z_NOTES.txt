So the AppUser to Category classes are one to many?
And the Category to Contact classes are many to many?

Why would we need a one to many relationship between the AppUser and Category classes
Isn't that covered by the many to many with the contact and category?
Why would the AppUser need a category, It seems only contacts get a category?
Does a contact automatically become a user?

are these the same?
`var contacts = new List<Contact>();`
`List<Contact> contacts = new();`


what is the purpose of this line for the categories select box
`onfocus="this.selectedIndex=-1;this.blur();`

in the SearchCotacts method we have
`return View(nameof(Index),contacts);`
I wonder how this works since the index view is expecting an `int categoryId` to be passed into it.


Are these the same?
 = string.Empty;
 = "";
